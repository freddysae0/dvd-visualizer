# DVD Player Simulator

Welcome to the DVD Player Simulator, a creative and interactive project that brings the classic DVD player screen to life in your browser. This project is designed to mimic the refresh screen that DVD players display after a period of inactivity, providing a nostalgic experience for users. Additionally, it introduces a unique feature that allows users to control the movement of the DVD image on the screen by adjusting the `velocidadX` and `velocidadY` values.

## Features

- **DVD Player Screen Simulation**: Recreate the DVD player's refresh screen in your browser.
- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust the inputs to control the velocity of the DVD image.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes to ensure a smooth experience across devices.
